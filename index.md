## Biography

Ngoc Bui is currently a research resident under supervision of Dr. Viet-Anh Nguyen at VinAI Research. He is also pursuing a Master degree in Data Science and Artifical Intelligence at Hanoi University of Science and Technology.

He received a BEng in computer science (under supervision of Assoc. Prof. Do Phan Thuan and Dr. Nguyen Phi Le) from Hanoi University of Science and Technology in 2021. Throughout the time at university, he also participated in research projects in Natural Language Processing (with Dr. Viet-Trung Tran in DSLAB) and Operation Research (with Assoc. Prof. Huynh Thi Thanh Binh in MSOLAB) as a collaborator.


He is interested in tackling combinatorial/operation research problems, and promoting robustness and explainability in machine learning models using distributional robust optimization, reinforcement learning, and graph neural network.
