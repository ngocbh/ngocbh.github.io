## Biography

I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Yale University, advised by Prof. Rex Ying. Prior to Yale, I spent two wonderful years as a research resident at VinAI Research under the supervision of Prof. Viet Anh Nguyen. Before that, I earned a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and a master’s degree in Data Science from Hanoi University of Science and Technology.

My research interests broadly include large language models (LLMs) and their applications, such as personalized assistants and synthetic data generation through simulations. I am also very interested in developing effective memory paradigms that enable LLMs to store and continually update their knowledge, which I believe is crucial for creating personalized and (multi-) agentic systems.
